# UltraModern Agent Contract

This workspace is generated as an agent-ready UltraModern.js SuperApp shell.
Codex should treat the files under `.codex/skills` as local project
instructions, not optional reading.

## Quality Gates

Generated workspaces target Node `>=26` and pnpm `11.9.0`. Keep
`packageManager`, `.mise.toml`, generated validation, and CI aligned to that
baseline; do not reintroduce Corepack or older pnpm aliases.

- `pnpm lint` runs Oxlint with the Ultracite preset.
- `pnpm format` runs oxfmt.
- `pnpm typecheck` runs TS7 native-preview through effect-tsgo in project-reference build mode with parallel `--checkers` and `--builders`.
- `pnpm i18n:boundaries` verifies workspace source boundaries through `@modern-js/code-tools`.
- `pnpm contract:check` verifies the generated workspace contract.
- `pnpm mf:types` verifies Module Federation type outputs after builds.
- `pnpm check` is a local convenience aggregate for the primitive gates.
- Generated CI runs primitive gates as separate matrix jobs instead of calling `pnpm check`.
- Generated Codex stop hooks and subagent-stop hooks run `pnpm format && pnpm lint:fix && pnpm check`.
- `postinstall` formats the generated tree, installs/updates pinned Codex skills, and installs `lefthook`. It never installs system packages. Clone-backed public skills are attempted by default; offline clone failures are advisory. Reference repos remain an explicit `pnpm agents:refs:install` step. Generated `lefthook.yml` runs separate format and lint-fix commands on pre-commit; pre-push runs read-only primitive gates in parallel.

## Localized Routes

Generated apps keep locale-prefixed entry routes under `src/routes/[lang]`,
static language links, and canonical plus `hreflang` metadata. A new workspace
starts shell-only; `create <domain> --vertical` adds route-owned metadata,
localized resources, and Effect BFF surfaces for that domain. Runtime i18n is
not enabled in the starter because the current React 19 + Module Federation
streaming SSR stack must render predictably first. Canonical and hreflang URLs
use `MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` only. JS/CSS/static assets use
`MODERN_ASSET_PREFIX`, then `ULTRAMODERN_ASSET_PREFIX`, then `/`; do not use
`MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` or stale public URL aliases as asset-prefix fallbacks.
Without an asset prefix, builds emit origin-relative asset paths so pages work
behind tunnels and reverse proxies.

## Required Skill Baseline

Use these skills when the task touches the matching subsystem:

- `rsbuild-best-practices`: Modern.js app build configuration, Rsbuild options, assets, type checking, and build debugging.
- `rspack-best-practices`: Rspack-level bundling, CSS, assets, profiling, and production build behavior.
- `rspack-tracing`: Rspack build failures, slow builds, crash localization, and trace analysis.
- `rsdoctor-analysis`: Evidence-based bundle analysis from `rsdoctor-data.json`, including duplicate packages, large chunks, and retained modules.
- `rslib-best-practices`: Shared packages, generated libraries, declaration output, and Rslib configuration.
- `rslib-modern-package`: Package contracts for shared libraries, exports, side effects, dependency placement, README, and release readiness.
- `rstest-best-practices`: Rstest configuration, test writing, mocking, snapshots, coverage, and CI test behavior.
- `mf`: Module Federation docs, Modern.js integration, DTS/type checks, shared dependency checks, runtime errors, and observability troubleshooting.

Skill bodies are lockfile-pinned in `.codex/skills-lock.json` and installed
into the repo-owned `.codex/skills` directory by default. The installer updates
only pinned skill directories and preserves unrelated user skills already
present under `.codex/skills`. Set `ULTRAMODERN_SKIP_CODEX_SKILLS=1` or
`ULTRAMODERN_CODEX_SKILLS=0` to opt out during install. `pnpm skills:check` is
advisory when local skill bodies are missing so offline CI can still run the
normal gate.

## Private Skills

ScriptedAlchemy/TechsioCZ skills are private and are cloned only when the current developer is authorized for `TechsioCZ/skills`.

```bash
pnpm skills:install
```

The installer copies only the pinned private skills from `.codex/skills-lock.json`: `plan-graph`, `dag`, `subagent-graph`, `helm`, and `debugger-mode`.

## Agent Reference Repositories

The workspace can install read-only source references under `repos/` with the explicit `pnpm agents:refs:install` command using `git subtree add --squash`. These repositories are reference material for coding agents, not application source:

- `repos/effect` from `Effect-TS/effect`.
- `repos/ultramodern.js` from `BleedingDev/ultramodern.js`.

Agents may read files under `repos/` to understand upstream patterns, APIs, and project conventions. Do not edit files under `repos/`, import from them, or make production code depend on them. `ULTRAMODERN_SKIP_AGENT_REPOS=1` disables the installer even when invoked explicitly.

## Project Priorities

- Keep `presetUltramodern` as the single preset.
- Maximize TS7 latest dev usage through `@typescript/native-preview` and TS-Go. Keep classic `typescript` on latest TS6 only for compatibility peers and tooling that cannot consume native-preview yet.
- Keep the initial workspace shell-only unless a user explicitly asks for a
  starter vertical.
- Use `create <domain> --vertical` as the growth path for real business
  MicroVerticals.
- Prefer Effect for BFF code.
- Prefer TanStack Router for app routing.
- Keep UI-kit or design-system code as ordinary vertical or shared package code, not a special core path.
- Keep generated packages explicit and publishable: stable `exports`, correct declarations, small public APIs, and clear ownership metadata.
- Do not add migration tooling or codemods unless the project owner explicitly asks for migration work.

## Skill Provenance

The Rstack skills, public Module Federation skill, and private TechsioCZ skill set are pinned in `.codex/skills-lock.json`. Do not update, remove, or replace them casually. If a skill needs updating, update the lock file and run the affected primitive gate plus `pnpm check`.
