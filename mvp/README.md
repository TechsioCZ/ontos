Generated UltraModern SuperApp workspace.

This workspace keeps `presetUltramodern(...)` as the single public
UltraModern.js 3.0 SuperApp surface and starts with an explicit shell:

- `apps/shell-super-app` owns shell route assembly, Module Federation host
  wiring, shared SSR/i18n runtime setup, and the boundary debugger.
- `packages/shared-*` provide placeholders for cross-workspace contracts,
  design tokens, and Effect API sharing.
- `verticals/*` is intentionally empty until a real business domain is added.

Add a full-stack MicroVertical when the product needs one:

```bash
pnpm dlx @bleedingdev/modern-js-create transportation --vertical
pnpm dlx @bleedingdev/modern-js-create payments --vertical
```

Each added vertical owns its UI/routes, browser-safe Module Federation exposes,
private-first route metadata, localized URLs, public-route opt-ins, CSS prefix,
Effect BFF handlers, local API contract, and typed client surface. Server
handlers and Effect client/contract modules stay out of browser exposes.

## Private-First Public Surfaces

Generated app routes are private and non-indexable by default. Private app,
auth, tenant, dashboard, and internal routes publish no discovery output unless
route metadata explicitly marks them `public && indexable`. The default scaffold
therefore emits only a disallowing `robots.txt`; sitemap, web manifest,
`llms.txt`, API catalog, security.txt, and JSON-LD output stay omitted until a
safe public route or public docs/help/product surface exists.

Run the scaffold validator before adding business code and after every
`--vertical` mutation:

```bash
mise install
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
```

Generated CI does not call the local aggregate. It runs format, lint,
typecheck, skills, i18n boundary validation, contract validation, and build as
separate matrix jobs so failures are isolated and parallelizable.

By default, `pnpm install` also prepares read-only agent reference repositories
under `repos/` for Effect and UltraModern.js source lookup using squashed git
subtrees. Disable this setup with
`ULTRAMODERN_SKIP_AGENT_REPOS=1 pnpm install`, or rerun it
explicitly with `pnpm agents:refs:install`.

Agent skills are prepared during `pnpm install` as a developer convenience.
External skill repository failures do not block postinstall; strict installation
is available with `pnpm skills:install`. Use
`ULTRAMODERN_SKIP_AGENT_SKILLS=1` for a dependency install that avoids external
skill repositories completely.

The topology and ownership metadata are generated under `topology/`. The
workspace also ships `.github/workflows/ultramodern-workspace-gates.yml` and
`.github/renovate.json` with read-only workflow permissions, commit-pinned
actions, frozen installs, StepSecurity audit-mode runner hardening, dependency
dashboard review, one-day release age, grouped updates, and manual approval for
major upgrades.

Package source metadata is generated at
`.modernjs/ultramodern-package-source.json`. The default strategy keeps
UltraModern.js runtime and tooling packages on `workspace:*` for monorepo
development. To create a workspace that can install those packages outside the
monorepo, generate with `--ultramodern-package-source install`; generated shared
packages still use `workspace:*` because they are part of this workspace.

## Cloudflare Proof

Deploy the generated apps, then pass each deployed app's generated public URL
env key into the proof step. A shell-only workspace only needs the shell URL;
added verticals use the same `ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_<APP_ID>` pattern with
hyphens converted to underscores and uppercased.

```bash
pnpm cloudflare:deploy
ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_SHELL_SUPER_APP=https://shell-super-app.example.workers.dev \
pnpm cloudflare:proof -- --require-public-urls
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                     | Current check                                                                                                                                                     | Owner                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Package cohort mismatch     | Regenerate with one package source strategy, run `mise install`, then rerun `pnpm install` from the activated shell.                                              | Generated workspace package source metadata |
| Install failure             | Check the active Node/pnpm from `mise install`; rerun `pnpm install` after the shell sees the pinned versions.                                                    | Toolchain setup                             |
| Build failure               | Run the matching primitive gate (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm i18n:boundaries`, `pnpm contract:check`) before `pnpm build`; fix the owning failure first. | Owning package or generated contract        |
| Missing public URL          | Set the env key from `.modernjs/ultramodern-generated-contract.json`, for example `ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_SHELL_SUPER_APP`.                                       | Deployment operator                         |
| Cloudflare credentials      | Confirm Wrangler credentials before `pnpm cloudflare:deploy`; local checks do not prove live Worker access.                                                       | Deployment operator                         |
| Asset or CSS 404            | Rebuild with `pnpm build` or `pnpm cloudflare:deploy` and inspect emitted Modern/Rspack asset paths instead of hardcoding CSS URLs.                               | Framework/runtime asset pipeline            |
| Federation manifest failure | Run the shell and vertical build scripts, then check each deployed `/mf-manifest.json` URL used by the shell.                                                     | Module Federation owner                     |
