Generated UltraModern SuperApp workspace.

This workspace keeps `presetUltramodern(...)` as the single public
UltraModern.js 3.0 SuperApp surface and starts with an explicit shell:

- `apps/shell-super-app` owns shell route assembly, Module Federation host
  wiring, shared SSR/i18n runtime setup, and the boundary debugger.
- `packages/shared-*` provide placeholders for cross-workspace contracts and
  design tokens.
- `verticals/*` is intentionally empty until a real business domain is added.

Add a full-stack MicroVertical when the product needs one:

```bash
pnpm dlx @bleedingdev/modern-js-create transportation --vertical
pnpm dlx @bleedingdev/modern-js-create payments --vertical
```

Each added vertical owns its UI/routes, browser-safe Module Federation exposes,
private-first route metadata, localized URLs, public-route opt-ins, CSS prefix,
Effect BFF handlers, local API contract, and typed client surface. Server
handlers and Effect client/contract modules stay out of browser exposes.

## Private-First Public Surfaces

Generated app routes are private and non-indexable by default. Author route
metadata in colocated `src/routes/**/route.meta.ts` files; the scaffold
regenerates `src/routes/ultramodern-route-metadata.ts` as a compatibility
manifest for config, i18n, public head, and public surface contracts. Private
app, auth, tenant, dashboard, and internal routes publish no discovery output
unless route metadata explicitly marks them `public && indexable`. The default
scaffold therefore emits only a disallowing `robots.txt`; sitemap, web
manifest, `llms.txt`, API catalog, security.txt, and JSON-LD output stay
omitted until a safe public route or public docs/help/product surface exists.
Structured data is never inferred automatically. Add `jsonLd` explicitly in
route metadata for `public && indexable` routes and use
`src/routes/ultramodern-jsonld.ts` when the route fits the generated `WebPage`,
`WebApplication`, `SoftwareApplication`, `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`, or
`Organization` helpers. Private or non-indexable routes emit no JSON-LD even
when they have localized paths, titles, descriptions, BFF APIs, or Module
Federation boundaries.

Public web artifacts are build/deploy outputs generated into `dist/public` and
`.output/public`, not hand-authored source files under `config/public`. Dynamic
public routes can expand sitemap entries through route-owned, Node-safe
`route.sitemap.mjs` providers beside route metadata. The public-surface
generator discovers those providers for dynamic public routes and still honors
explicit `routes.publicSurface.contentSources` entries in the generated
compatibility manifest.

Run the scaffold validator before adding business code and after every
`--vertical` mutation:

```bash
mise install
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
```

The generated toolchain baseline is Node `>=26` with pnpm `11.5.3`.
`packageManager`, `.mise.toml`, generated validation, and CI should all agree
on that baseline; do not reintroduce Corepack or older pnpm aliases.

Generated CI does not call the local aggregate. It runs format, lint,
typecheck, skills, i18n boundary validation, contract validation, and build as
separate matrix jobs so failures are isolated and parallelizable.

Read-only agent reference repositories under `repos/` (Effect and
UltraModern.js source lookup using squashed git subtrees) are an explicit
opt-in step: run `pnpm agents:refs:install` when you want them. `pnpm install`
never clones repositories.

Vendored agent skills ship with the scaffold. Clone-installed skills (such as
the Module Federation `mf` skill) are fetched only when you explicitly run
`pnpm skills:install`, or when `ULTRAMODERN_AGENT_SKILLS=1` is set during
`pnpm install`. `pnpm skills:check` warns about missing clone-installed skills
without failing the gate.

The topology and ownership metadata are generated under `topology/`. The
workspace also ships `.github/workflows/ultramodern-workspace-gates.yml` and
`.github/renovate.json` with read-only workflow permissions, commit-pinned
actions, frozen installs, StepSecurity audit-mode runner hardening, dependency
dashboard review, one-day release age, grouped updates, and manual approval for
major upgrades.

Package source metadata is generated at
`.modernjs/ultramodern-package-source.json`. The default strategy keeps
UltraModern.js runtime and tooling packages on `workspace:*` for monorepo
development. To create a workspace that can install those packages outside the
monorepo, generate with `--ultramodern-package-source install`; generated shared
packages still use `workspace:*` because they are part of this workspace.

## Public URL Environment Variables

This workspace's apps must not bake absolute `http://localhost:<port>` URLs
into asset configuration. Public URL and asset prefix environment variables
have distinct roles, and stale aliases should not be carried forward when
regenerating or updating the workspace.

| Variable                          | Role                                             | Feeds                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`          | Canonical site origin for public SEO output only | Canonical, hreflang, sitemap `<loc>`, robots `Sitemap:`              |
| `MODERN_ASSET_PREFIX`             | Preferred JS/CSS/static asset prefix             | Modern/Rspack-emitted asset URLs                                     |
| `ULTRAMODERN_ASSET_PREFIX`        | UltraModern compatibility asset prefix           | Modern/Rspack-emitted asset URLs when `MODERN_ASSET_PREFIX` is unset |
| `ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_<APP_ID>` | Per-app deployment/proof URL                     | Cloudflare proof inputs and Module Federation remote URLs            |

Asset URLs use this precedence: `MODERN_ASSET_PREFIX` →
`ULTRAMODERN_ASSET_PREFIX` → origin-relative `/`. `MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is
canonical/SEO-only and must not be used as an asset-prefix fallback.
SEO output uses `MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; if it is unset, generated local and
preview outputs remain non-public until deployment proof provides explicit
public URLs.

Without public URLs configured, asset paths are origin-relative (`/`), and the
dev server uses `dev.assetPrefix: '/'` — so apps work through tunnels and
reverse proxies (ngrok, cloudflared) without triggering Chrome's Local Network
Access prompt or mixed-content errors. Shell-only workspaces can set
`MODERN_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` for SEO output without changing where assets load
from.

## Cloudflare Proof

Deploy the generated apps, then pass each deployed app's generated public URL
env key into the proof step. The proof script reads the generated contract and
checks the live Worker surface, including public-route sitemap/robots
consistency, preview noindex behavior, unknown-route status, asset headers,
byte budgets, and public sourcemap exposure. A shell-only workspace only needs
the shell URL; added verticals use the same `ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_<APP_ID>`
pattern with hyphens converted to underscores and uppercased.

```bash
pnpm cloudflare:deploy
ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_SHELL_SUPER_APP=https://shell-super-app.example.workers.dev \
pnpm cloudflare:proof -- --require-public-urls
```

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Package cohort mismatch     | Regenerate with one package source strategy, run `mise install`, then rerun `pnpm install` from the activated shell.                                              | Generated workspace package source metadata |
| Install failure             | Check the active Node/pnpm from `mise install`; rerun `pnpm install` after the shell sees the pinned versions.                                                    | Toolchain setup                             |
| Build failure               | Run the matching primitive gate (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm i18n:boundaries`, `pnpm contract:check`) before `pnpm build`; fix the owning failure first. | Owning package or generated contract        |
| Missing public URL          | Set the env key from `.modernjs/ultramodern-generated-contract.json`, for example `ULTRAMODERN_PUBLIC_URL_SHELL_SUPER_APP`.                                       | Deployment operator                         |
| Cloudflare credentials      | Confirm Wrangler credentials before `pnpm cloudflare:deploy`; local checks do not prove live Worker access.                                                       | Deployment operator                         |
| Asset or CSS 404            | Rebuild with `pnpm build` or `pnpm cloudflare:deploy` and inspect emitted Modern/Rspack asset paths instead of hardcoding CSS URLs.                               | Framework/runtime asset pipeline            |
| Federation manifest failure | Run the shell and vertical build scripts, then check each deployed `/mf-manifest.json` URL used by the shell.                                                     | Module Federation owner                     |
